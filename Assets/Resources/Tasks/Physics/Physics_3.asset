  question: What does Newton's third law of motivation state?
  correct:
  - When a force acts on a body due to another body, then an equal and opposite force
    acts simultaneously on that body.
  wrong:
  - A body's rate of change of momentum is proportional to the force causing it.
  - A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon
    by a force.
