  question: What does Newton's first law of motion state?
  correct:
  - 'A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted
    upon by a force. '
  wrong:
  - A body's rate of change of momentum is proportional to the force causing it.
  - When a force acts on a body due to another body, then an equal and opposite force
    acts simultaneously on that body.
